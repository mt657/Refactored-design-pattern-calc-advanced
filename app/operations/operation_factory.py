# ==============================================================================
# FACTORY PATTERN FOR CREATING OPERATIONS
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The OperationFactory class.
# What: Creates instances of operation classes based on a given operation name.
# Why: To encapsulate object creation, promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
# Where: Used whenever a new operation needs to be created based on user input.
# When: At runtime, during the calculator's execution.
# How: By mapping operation names to their corresponding classes.

# Why use the Factory Pattern?
# - It provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class.
# - Enhances flexibility and scalability; new operations can be added without modifying existing code.
