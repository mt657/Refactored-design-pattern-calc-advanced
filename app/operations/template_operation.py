# OPERATION CLASSES (COMMAND AND TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERNS)
# ==============================================================================

# Who: These classes are the core components that perform arithmetic operations.
# What: Implement arithmetic operations using design patterns.
# Why: To demonstrate OOP principles and design patterns for clean, maintainable code.
# Where: In the calculator application we are building.
# When: Whenever an arithmetic operation is requested.
# How: By defining a base class and extending it for specific operations.

# We will implement the Command Pattern, where each operation (e.g., addition, subtraction)
# is encapsulated as an object. The Template Method Pattern is used to define the
# skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
